C++ OOP Concepts Repository
This repository provides practical implementations and examples of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in C++. It includes various classes, inheritance structures, and polymorphism examples designed to demonstrate real-world scenarios and coding best practices.
Contents
1. Encapsulation
* Focuses on the principles of encapsulation, data hiding, and abstraction.
* Examples:
o Classes demonstrating getter and setter functions.
o Private, protected, and public access specifiers.
2. Inheritance
* Comprehensive coverage of inheritance in C++ with practical examples of:
o Single Inheritance: Demonstrating a simple parent-child relationship.
o Multilevel Inheritance: Extending the inheritance hierarchy.
o Multiple Inheritance: Combining properties from multiple parent classes.
o Hierarchical Inheritance: A parent class with multiple child classes.
o Hybrid Inheritance: Complex combinations of multiple inheritance styles.
* Examples include geometric shapes and their derived variations.
3. Polymorphism
* Illustrates runtime and compile-time polymorphism.
* Concepts:
o Virtual Methods: Demonstrating overridden behavior in derived classes.
o Abstract Classes: Forcing derived classes to implement specific methods.
o Dynamic Binding: Using base class pointers to invoke derived class methods at runtime.
* Includes examples such as area calculations for various geometric shapes (Rect, Square, Triangle) using pure virtual functions.
